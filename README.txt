README - Staubfaenger on Github by Christian MÃ¼nch
This Arduino sketch is for a project I did during my studies at the University of Applied Science Potsdam. The according hardware uses a Sharp Dust-Sensor an an input device and a flip-dot as an output device. Depending on the amount of dust in the air, the dot flips to one of its two sides.
